## Repository scope

This repository owns the focused, client-side normalized Wald relative-support application.
Released `wald-inference` is the sole numerical authority. Local code may validate a request,
assemble the focused response, choose a display grid, produce warnings, serialize strict browser
JSON, and render or export the result. It must not implement a Wald, likelihood, support-ratio, or
support-interval formula; change the explicit `log L(A)/L(B)` order; conflate S−2 with a 2:1
interval; or add compatibility/p-values as a primary output, repeated-study design metrics,
selection rules, Type S/M, information multipliers, precision targets, priors, posteriors, Bayes
factors, clinical thresholds, or decision support.

Use public issue forms only for nonsensitive engineering, scientific-boundary, and accessibility
reports. Report vulnerabilities through the private process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Never
place credentials, protected health information, patient-level data, unpublished restricted data,
or other sensitive values in an issue, pull request, fixture, screenshot, URL, or workflow log.

## Change process

1. Start from the current `main` branch and make one reviewable change.
2. State assumptions, success criteria, silent-failure risks, and verification before editing.
3. Route any missing scientific formula or primitive to `wald-inference-core`, release it there,
   and adopt only its exact released artifact.
4. Keep Python under `src/` as source of truth and regenerate browser Python with `make stage-web`.
5. Keep the scientific Core exact-version and checksum bound in metadata, lock, and staging
   configuration.
6. Keep third-party GitHub Actions pinned to full commit SHAs with version comments.
7. Open a pull request and let all required checks complete before merging.

Do not add a backend, telemetry, persistence, cookies, hidden state, input-bearing URLs, uploads,
or out-of-scope calculations as conveniences.

## Verification

Restore the locked environment and run the complete documented suite:

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run playwright install chromium webkit
make verify
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Changes to the browser worker, staging, interface, or export behavior require both Chromium and
WebKit verification. Scientific changes require the frozen B01–B03/B08 regressions, generic
support identities, exact-vs-approximate wording review, and exact Core provenance checks. Document
every skipped check or warning.

## Release changes

A release change requires a reviewed pull request and a signed, annotated version tag pointing to
the exact reviewed merge commit. The tag must equal `v` plus the authoritative project version,
and that version needs a nonempty changelog section. The tag workflow:

1. cryptographically verifies the tag before executing repository code;
2. requires the verified tag target to be contained in protected `main` history and match the
   project version;
3. verifies the complete suite with read-only contents permission;
4. builds and checksums all assets before creating a release;
5. transfers the complete bundle to a narrowly write-enabled publishing job;
6. requires repository release immutability;
7. creates a draft stable release using only the current version's changelog section;
8. downloads and compares every draft asset and the release body; and
9. publishes only the verified draft once as stable.

Before creating the tag, enable immutable releases and configure a repository-administration read
token as the `RELEASE_SETTINGS_READ_TOKEN` Actions secret. The publishing job uses that secret only
for the fail-closed settings query; release creation uses the job-scoped GitHub token.

If a release job fails after draft creation, leave the release as a draft for inspection. Do not
replace assets or move a tag after publication.
