# Codex AGENTS

## Purpose

- This repository is the focused static app for normalized Wald relative support reconstructed
  from a reported estimate and two-sided 95% confidence interval.
- Released `wald-inference` is the sole numerical authority. The local package owns strict request
  validation, browser payloads, display choices, warnings, and exports.
- Python under `src/wald_likelihood_support/` is source of truth; generated browser Python is ignored.

## Commands

- Setup: `uv sync --locked`
- Stage: `make stage-web`
- Format: `make fmt`
- Verify formatting: `make fmt-check`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Python/integration/template tests: `make test`
- Chromium: `make e2e`
- WebKit smoke: `make e2e-webkit-smoke`
- Full verification: `make verify`

## Working rules

- Before non-trivial changes, state assumptions, ambiguities, tradeoffs, success criteria, risks,
  expected files, and verification commands.
- Never copy a Wald, likelihood, support-ratio, or support-interval formula into this app. Add a
  missing primitive to `wald-inference` and release it before adoption.
- Keep the response limited to `meta`, `reconstruction`, the five-field likelihood `grid`,
  `support_interval`, `reference_support`, `pairwise_comparisons`, and `warnings`.
- Do not add compatibility/p-values as a primary output, repeated-study design metrics, selection
  rules, Type S/M, information multipliers, precision targets, priors, or Bayes factors.
- Preserve the explicit pairwise order `log L(A)/L(B)`, retain the finite log result when a natural
  ratio overflows or underflows, and describe the likelihood as normalized and approximate.
- Run staging; never hand-edit `web/assets/py/`.
- Keep external scientific dependencies exact-version locked and, for URL artifacts, checksum
  bound in package metadata, `uv.lock`, and `browser-stage.toml`.
- Preserve client-side privacy: no backend, telemetry, persistence, cookies, PHI logging, or
  input-bearing URLs.
- Keep accessible textual output; a plot must never be the sole carrier of a result.
- Use `uv`, Ruff, pytest, Hypothesis, and Playwright; do not add parallel toolchains casually.

## Skills

- Plan non-trivial work with `.agents/skills/implementation-strategy/SKILL.md`.
- Verify browser/staging work with `.agents/skills/browser-verification/SKILL.md`.
- Review input or deployment changes with `.agents/skills/privacy-review/SKILL.md`.
- Synchronize behavior and public docs with `.agents/skills/docs-sync/SKILL.md`.

## Done criteria

- Relevant unit, contract, property, initializer, staging, privacy, Chromium, and WebKit checks
  pass.
- Stage output is reproducible from a clean checkout without a sibling repository.
- B01–B03/B08 likelihood/S−2 parity and generic support identities pass at documented tolerances.
- Scientific scope, exact-vs-approximate wording, validation, privacy, citation, maintenance, and
  decisions are truthful.
- The final report names commands, results, generated files, limitations, and residual risks.
